# Surfs_Up Challenge

## Overview

In the midst of business strategy for a surf shop, these temperature analyses were collected for Oahu's December and June months to ensure stability despite seasonal changes. 

## Results

* The most impactful difference is the minimum temperatures in each month. December is capable of producing a far more cold extreme.

* About 25% of the temperature data is 4 degress warmer in June than in December.

* By the third quartile is reached, the delta between the temperatures has declined to a difference of 3 degrees.

## Summary 

Overall, the summary statistics for both December and June are not terribly different. This is very promising that this shop could be successful even in the off seasons for the activity. 

Two additional queries could be included for further insight: 
(1) One query to look at the levels of cloudiness that might affect the desirability of surfing.
(2) A second query to assess the conditions and likelihood of tropical storms and hurricanes. This would be helpful for assessing the risks involved with potential damage and unpredicted time for the business to be closed.
